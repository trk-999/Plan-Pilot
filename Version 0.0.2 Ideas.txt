Add more customization options: Consider allowing users to choose the colors of the text, background, and other elements in the popup window. 
This could be achieved through either a settings menu or using browser storage to remember users' preferences.

Add reminders and notifications: Allow users to set reminders for specific tasks or to receive notifications for overdue tasks.

Implement drag and drop: Allow users to drag and drop tasks between different lists or to reorder tasks within a list.

Add a calendar view: Display tasks on a calendar so users can easily see when they are due.

Integrate with other services: Allow users to sync their tasks with other to-do list apps or calendar services such as Google Calendar.

Add keyboard shortcuts: Implement keyboard shortcuts so users can quickly add or delete tasks without having to use the mouse.

Use animations: Consider using animations to make the user interface more engaging and intuitive. For example, you could animate tasks as they are added or removed from a list.

Make it mobile-friendly: Ensure that your extension is usable on mobile devices by making the interface responsive and touch-friendly.

Allow collaboration: Consider adding features that would allow multiple users to collaborate on the same to-do list. This could include real-time updates, chat functionality, and user permissions.

Add voice control: Allow users to add and remove tasks by speaking commands to their device's voice assistant, such as Siri or Google Assistant.
